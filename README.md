# Simple Calculator in C++

This is a simple command-line calculator application written in C++.  
It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).  
If division by zero is attempted, the program handles it gracefully with a warning.

## üìå About the Project

This project was developed as a basic exercise to practice object-oriented programming in C++ and working with header files.  
It is also **my very first project using both C++ and Git/GitHub**, so any feedback is greatly appreciated!

## üìÅ File Structure

- `main.cpp` ‚Äì Contains the main function and user interaction loop.
- `calculator.h` ‚Äì Declaration of the `calculator` class.
- `calculator.cpp` ‚Äì Implementation of the `calculator` class and its `calculate()` method.
